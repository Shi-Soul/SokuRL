当前原生模块拒绝 `GotoFrame`，不能把下文历史上的帧导航与场景重建说明当作已完成的任意状态恢复接口。ABI 8 合并了保留进程的 `ResetEpisode` 和有符号灵力字段；重置通过游戏场景流程重建对局。旧 ABI 7 的完整轨迹验证已通过，合并后的版本需要重新验证。公共接口为 PettingZoo 双人环境，默认提供经过可见性和精度过滤的状态，也支持真实图像。已接入 TorchRL、BenchMARL IPPO、OpenSpiel NFSP 和 PSRO；最终策略胜率和联网人机对战尚未验收。入口与分层见[双人环境文档](docs/multi-agent-env.md)。

AI 工作进程默认静音，配置为 `runtime.mute_audio=true`。模块只在该游戏进程内把音乐和音效的音量设为零，不修改系统总音量、原始游戏文件或保存的游戏音量配置。

SokuRL is a Windows control and state-extraction layer for Touhou Hisoutensoku
(`th123`) 1.10a. It currently provides deterministic local Practice and VS Player
automation, per-simulation-frame battle state, logical input control, replay
seeking, reproducible scenario anchors, multi-instance isolation, and an
experimentally validated faster-than-real-time VS worker.

The public RL interface is a two-player PettingZoo environment. Training adapters
use BenchMARL IPPO and OpenSpiel NFSP and PSRO. Policy quality and network play
still need validation. See the current Chinese RL guide linked above.

## SokuRL Platform Highlights

- Game: Touhou Hisoutensoku 1.10a
- Executable: `th123_jp/th123.exe`
- Required MD5: `DF35D1FBC7B583317ADABE8CD9F53B2E`
- Game architecture: Win32/x86
- Python environment: repository-local Python 3.11 x64 in `.venv`
- Native compiler: MSVC Win32/x86
- Bridge ABI: version 8

Historical platform measurements from upstream commit `b40607c`:

- **28,000+ sim-FPS** on one unlocked worker, about 467x real time
- **150,000+ aggregate sim-FPS** with 8 recording-stable workers
- **10,000-frame deterministic equivalence** across rendered, headless, and
  unlimited execution
- **14,954-frame expert replay capture** with zero dropped records
- Replay-verified spell-card selection/consumption and signed spirit observation
- Deterministic reconstruction with up to **55 live objects** in one player's
  object list
- Automated local VS Player startup with independent P1/P2 logical control

These historical measurements cover the native simulation loop. They do not
measure Python observation generation or policy inference. Current training and
validation results are recorded in [the validation log](docs/env-validation.md).

The learning stack includes fixed-opponent PPO, BenchMARL IPPO, and OpenSpiel
NFSP and PSRO. Human-track training uses one decision every 3 frames and a
5-frame action delay. Final policy benchmarks and network play remain open.

## Architecture

The platform's runtime topology is:

```text

                         |
                observations / actions

            battle     battle     battle
            engine     engine     engine
```

Each worker runs the original th123 simulation. SokuRL Platform observes and
controls the game at its logical frame boundary, so collision, animation,
hitstop, weather, cards, projectiles, and character-specific behavior still
come from the game.

## Requirements

- Windows
- A legally obtained Touhou Hisoutensoku 1.10a installation
- `th123.exe` MD5: `DF35D1FBC7B583317ADABE8CD9F53B2E`
- Conda or Miniforge for a repository-local Python 3.11 x64 environment
- Git
- MSVC with Win32/x86 support for native bridge builds

The game executable and proprietary game data are **not distributed with this
repository**. SokuRL does not patch `th123.exe`, `th123a.dat`, `th123b.dat`, or
`th123c.dat` on disk.

Place a legally obtained th123 1.10a installation at `SokuRL/th123_jp/`, so the
supported executable is available as `SokuRL/th123_jp/th123.exe`.

Clone SokuRL and create the repository-local Python 3.11 x64 environment. The
documented command uses a Conda prefix because it creates the expected
`.venv\python.exe` layout without activating the Conda base environment:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/NoFumoNoWork/SokuRL.git
cd SokuRL
conda create --prefix .\.venv python=3.11 pip -y
.\.venv\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\python.exe -m pip install -e . --no-deps
.\.venv\python.exe -c "import struct; assert struct.calcsize('P') == 8; print('Python x64 OK')"
```

`requirements.txt` pins the direct runtime dependency used by the launcher and
validation tools. The editable install exposes the `src/` package while
`--no-deps` keeps `requirements.txt` as the single resolved dependency input.

Fetch the pinned native dependencies:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\bootstrap_sokumods.ps1
```

The bootstrap script creates the ignored local checkout
`third_party/SokuMods/`, checks out SokuMods commit
`eb0574cea1eda70484b736eb192964ef87e50a67`, initializes its recursive
submodules, verifies SkipIntro commit
`fd945ff5c1c5b7de0ff7d03b988e9219a3674213`, and applies the versioned SokuRL
patch described below. Existing checkouts at another commit are rejected rather
than reset.

All dependency identities and hashes are versioned in
[`config/dependencies.lock.json`](config/dependencies.lock.json). Verify an
existing source checkout at any time with:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\verify_sokumods.ps1
```

| Locked input | Identity |

Verify a local installation with:

```powershell
.\.venv\python.exe scripts\00_check_game.py
```

## Quick Start

Complete the SokuMods build, native bridge build, and runtime deployment steps
below before running these commands.

```powershell
# Stable local Practice preset
.\.venv\python.exe tools\sokurl.py practice

# Local VS Player through the normal Title -> Loading -> Battle lifecycle
.\.venv\python.exe tools\sokurl.py vs

# Keep the original simulation but skip complex battle rendering
.\.venv\python.exe tools\sokurl.py vs --headless

# Headless local VS without the original 60 FPS wall-clock wait
.\.venv\python.exe tools\sokurl.py vs --headless --unlimited
```

`--unlimited` requires `--headless`. Practice and normal VS retain their
original pacing and rendering behavior.

Manage running workers by PID:

```powershell
.\.venv\python.exe tools\sokurl.py list
.\.venv\python.exe tools\sokurl.py status --pid 1234
.\.venv\python.exe tools\sokurl.py shutdown --pid 1234
```

## What the Platform Exposes

### Structured battle state

Every actual simulation update produces a `RawFrameState` containing:

- Scene, battle mode/submode, stage, round, timer, weather, and RNG seed
- P1/P2 position, velocity, facing, HP, spirit, cards, action state, animation,
  hitstop, untech, airborne state, flags, and effective logical input
- Up to 64 objects per player with explicit overflow reporting
- Object ownership/type, action and animation state, position, velocity, HP,
  hitstop, hit/hurt boxes, and active state
- A canonical FNV-1a-64 state hash

Spirit is exposed with the game's signed 16-bit semantics in bridge ABI v8.
Transient values such as `-88` therefore remain negative instead of appearing
as `65448`. Hand-card IDs follow the game's selected-card order.

The shared-memory ABI uses a 512-frame SPSC ring. A consumer can detect any
recording loss through `dropped_frames`; overflow is never hidden.

### Logical actions and frame control

SokuRL Platform injects the game's logical `KeyInput`, not Windows keyboard
events. This removes window focus, keyboard layout, and IME from the control
path.

Available controls include:

- Atomic P1/P2 direction and A/B/C/D/card input
- Pause and resume
- `+1F` and `+NF`
- Episode reset through the game's scene lifecycle

`Goto frame N` and `-1F` are disabled in the current native module.
The historical reconstruction measurements below do not establish support for
restoring an arbitrary battle state.

One platform simulation frame is one call to the original
`BattleManager::onProcess`. The unlimited worker does not batch multiple updates
into one main-loop iteration or substitute a custom timestep.

### Deterministic reconstruction

The platform does not copy raw process memory. It reconstructs a target state
through the original simulation:

```text
deterministic frame-zero checkpoint
  -> replay recorded P1/P2 logical inputs
  -> simulate to the target frame
  -> restore documented scalar state when required
  -> freeze and compare the complete state hash
```

The scalar patch is limited to timer/weather, position, velocity, facing, HP,
spirit, and card counters. Actions, animation, hitstop, projectiles, and object
lists must match through re-simulation. A mismatch reports the first divergent
simulation frame and a field/object diff.

For local VS and Practice traces, reconstruction injects the recorded P1/P2
logical inputs. For a `.rep`, the checkpoint reuses ReplayInputManager's native
input stream: observed `KeyInput` alone does not encode every replay command
decision. Complex state is still simulated and compared on every frame.

### Replay capture and seek

ReplayDnD starts a `.rep` directly. The platform freezes replay frame zero and
can play normally or simulate to a requested frame:

```powershell
.\.venv\python.exe tools\sokurl.py replay path\match.rep
.\.venv\python.exe tools\sokurl.py replay path\match.rep --frame 5000
```

### ScenarioRunner v1

ScenarioRunner saves reproducible Practice anchors and runs per-frame opponent
scripts from them:

```powershell
.\.venv\python.exe tools\sokurl.py anchor save graze_test --pid 1234
.\.venv\python.exe tools\sokurl.py anchor load graze_test
.\.venv\python.exe tools\sokurl.py script run scenarios\graze_test.yaml --pid 5678
```

Scripts support waits, numpad-relative directions, direction/button inputs,
explicit raw sequences, and nested repeats:

```yaml
anchor: graze_test
opponent: p1
script:
  - wait: 30
  - raw: [{"input":"5B","frames":3}]
  - wait: 45
  - raw: [{"input":"2","frames":2},{"input":"1","frames":2},{"input":"4C","frames":3}]
  - wait: 60
```

## How VS Workers Start

The stable VS launcher uses the game's Title lifecycle. After Title initializes
its input and profile state, the bridge binds both local players, calls the
game's VS battle-mode routine, and returns through the original Loading path.

It does not write a scene ID or use SkipIntro's incomplete direct VS CSelect
path. The persistent SkipIntro configuration remains the stable Practice preset.

MemoryPatch supplies the existing community multi-instance patch. Each process
then owns an independent mapping:

```text
Local\SokuRLBridge_<pid>
```

## Headless and Unlimited Execution

Headless mode skips only the confirmed complex battle draw/present interval.
The window, D3D device, resources, audio, animation, effects, collision, RNG,
and object updates remain initialized and active.

Unlimited mode changes the VS battle frame wait from blocking to non-blocking.
The original main loop and one-update-per-frame semantics remain intact.

## Validation

The repository includes small, sanitized JSON artifacts for the headline
results:

- [M2-B determinism and throughput](docs/validation/m2b-summary.json)
- [Expert replay capture and seek](docs/validation/replay-summary.json)
- [Practice reconstruction and ScenarioRunner](docs/validation/reconstruction-summary.json)
- [Spell-card and signed-spirit validation](docs/validation/resources-summary.json)

### Determinism

- Rendered, headless paced, and headless unlimited execution matched for the
  required 3,000-frame trace and a 10,000-frame long run.
- The long-run final hash was `CC6DB833624518B5`.
- All three modes recorded zero divergent frames and zero dropped records.
- Coverage included A/B/C attacks, projectile spawn/movement/despawn, damage,
  hitstop, untech, airborne state, and corner interaction.

### Throughput

These measurements come from one development machine and are not portable
hardware guarantees.

| Workers | Mean sim-FPS / worker | Aggregate sim-FPS | Mean system CPU | Dropped | Result |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | 28,059.60 | 28,059.60 | 27.22% | 0 | Stable |
| 4 | 24,063.98 | 96,255.94 | 49.63% | 0 | Stable |
| 8 | 18,832.74 | 150,661.89 | 92.75% | 0 | Stable |
| 16 | 12,935.27 | 206,964.27 | 99.84% | 139 | CPU-saturated |

Eight workers were recording-stable on the test machine. At 16 workers, all
simulations remained alive but two frame rings overflowed under full CPU
contention, so the 16-worker result is a saturation measurement rather than an
accepted lossless configuration.

### Other acceptance results

- Local VS startup: 20/20 successful runs
- Headless startup: 20/20 successful runs
- Practice reconstruction targets: all hashes matched
- Scenario anchors: 20/20 fresh-process loads
- Scenario projectile runs: 3/3 identical traces and final hashes
- Expert replay: 14,954 contiguous frames, zero drops, up to 55 live objects
- Expert replay spell-card consumption: frame 3663 and 5822 reconstructions
  matched complete state hashes with zero field differences
- Signed spirit: `-88` round-trip and recovery matched across 3/3 deterministic
  VS runs; the supplied replay itself remained positive (minimum 50/16)
- Unit tests: 19/19 passed
- Two-process frame stepping: PID-isolated

## Runtime Modules

The tested local setup uses these SWRSToys modules:

```ini
[Module]
WindowResizer=modules/WindowResizer/WindowResizer.dll
SokuRLBridge=modules/SokuRLBridge/SokuRLBridge.dll
SkipIntro=modules/SkipIntro/SkipIntro.dll
MemoryPatch=modules/MemoryPatch/MemoryPatch.dll
ReplayDnD=modules/ReplayDnD/ReplayDnD.dll
```

Community module sources live under `third_party/SokuMods/`; the local game
installation remains outside version control.

## SkipIntro Reproducibility

SokuRL Platform does not build an unmodified upstream SkipIntro. The pinned
upstream source is patched so that a launch with one command-line argument
leaves startup to ReplayDnD:

```cpp
// ReplayDnD owns command-line file/directory launches and needs Logo to run.
if (__argc == 2)
    return;
```

Without this change, SkipIntro can intercept startup before ReplayDnD loads a
`.rep` file or replay directory. The exact source change is committed as
[`patches/skipintro-replaydnd-command-line.patch`](patches/skipintro-replaydnd-command-line.patch).
The bootstrap script applies it inside SkipIntro's own Git checkout and is
idempotent, so a second run verifies the already-applied patch. The patch also
normalizes the missing final newline in `Soku.hpp`; that second file has no
runtime behavior change. Both patched-file hashes are recorded in the dependency
lock.

The deployed Practice preset is versioned at
[`config/runtime/SkipIntro.ini`](config/runtime/SkipIntro.ini):

```ini
[GLOBAL]
scene_id = 3
menu_id = 0
type = 8
subtype = 0

[P1]
character = 1
palette = 0
deck = 0

[P2]
character = 0
palette = 0
deck = 0
```

This selects local Practice with P1 Marisa and P2 Reimu. `sokurl.py vs`
temporarily changes only the startup scene to Title, performs the validated
Title-context VS bootstrap, and restores the file afterward. Replay launches
pass the `.rep` path to `th123.exe`; the patch above keeps SkipIntro out of that
command-line path so ReplayDnD can own it.

## Build SokuMods Modules

Open an **x86 Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio**. From the SokuRL
root, configure the pinned checkout and build only the modules used here:

```cmd
cmake -S third_party\SokuMods -B third_party\SokuMods\build -A Win32 -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5
cmake --build third_party\SokuMods\build --config Release --target swrstoys WindowResizer SkipIntro MemoryPatch ReplayDnD
```

The policy compatibility option is required with CMake 4.x because the pinned
SokuMods dependency graph includes older projects such as mbedtls. It changes
CMake policy compatibility only; it does not patch those upstream sources.

After building, verify the recorded DLL SHA-256 values and x86 PE architecture:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts\verify_sokumods.ps1 `
  -BuildDirectory third_party\SokuMods\build\Release
```

The resulting Win32 binaries are:

```text
third_party/SokuMods/build/Release/d3d9.dll
third_party/SokuMods/build/Release/WindowResizer.dll
third_party/SokuMods/build/Release/SkipIntro.dll
third_party/SokuMods/build/Release/MemoryPatch.dll
third_party/SokuMods/build/Release/ReplayDnD.dll
```

## Build the Native Bridge

Open an **x86 Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio**, then run:

```cmd
cmake -S native\SokuRLBridge -B native\SokuRLBridge\build -A Win32
cmake --build native\SokuRLBridge\build --config Release --target SokuRLBridge
```

The output is:

```text
native\SokuRLBridge\build\Release\SokuRLBridge.dll
```

Do not build the bridge as x64.

`SokuRLBridge` links against the pinned
`third_party/SokuMods/SokuLib` checkout prepared by the bootstrap script.

## Deploy the Runtime

The repository includes the exact tested module configurations under
`config/runtime/`. After building SokuMods and SokuRLBridge, deploy only the mod
files:

```powershell
$game = Resolve-Path .\th123_jp
$release = Resolve-Path .\third_party\SokuMods\build\Release

Copy-Item "$release\d3d9.dll" "$game\d3d9.dll"
Copy-Item .\config\runtime\SWRSToys.ini "$game\SWRSToys.ini"

foreach ($module in @("WindowResizer", "SkipIntro", "MemoryPatch", "ReplayDnD")) {
    $destination = Join-Path $game "modules\$module"
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $destination | Out-Null
    Copy-Item "$release\$module.dll" "$destination\$module.dll"
    Copy-Item ".\config\runtime\$module.ini" "$destination\$module.ini"
}

$bridge = Join-Path $game "modules\SokuRLBridge"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $bridge | Out-Null
Copy-Item .\native\SokuRLBridge\build\Release\SokuRLBridge.dll `
  "$bridge\SokuRLBridge.dll"
```

This creates:

```text
th123_jp/
  d3d9.dll
  SWRSToys.ini
  modules/
    WindowResizer/WindowResizer.dll + WindowResizer.ini
    SokuRLBridge/SokuRLBridge.dll
    SkipIntro/SkipIntro.dll + SkipIntro.ini
    MemoryPatch/MemoryPatch.dll + MemoryPatch.ini
    ReplayDnD/ReplayDnD.dll + ReplayDnD.ini
```

The templates enable only the required multi-instance memory patch, configure
ReplayDnD for automatic shutdown and muted music, and preserve the deterministic
SkipIntro Practice preset. These commands do not overwrite `th123.exe` or any
`.dat` file. Review or back up existing mod DLLs and `.ini` files before
replacing an existing setup.

## Updating SokuMods or SkipIntro

Treat the dependency lock, patch, README, and validation evidence as one change.
When SokuMods or SkipIntro is updated:

1. Update the repository commit and Git tree hash in
   `config/dependencies.lock.json`.
2. Rebase or regenerate every patch under `patches/`; never leave a required
   source edit only in the ignored checkout.
3. Update the patch SHA-256 and every patched-file SHA-256 in the lock.
4. Rebuild Win32 from a clean directory, update the verified output hashes, and
   run `scripts/verify_sokumods.ps1` with `-BuildDirectory`.
5. Document behavior changes, especially SkipIntro startup ownership and config
   semantics, in this README and commit all related files together.

The verifier fails on a different commit, tree, patch, patched-file set, source
hash, output hash, or non-x86 DLL. This keeps an upstream update visible in Git
instead of silently changing the ignored `third_party/SokuMods/` checkout.

## Reproduce the Validations

The expert replay used for the published 14,954-frame result is not distributed
with this repository. Its byte identity is:

```text
size:    58,565 bytes
SHA-256: 3C08B5AFD23DF5ACDF80F058E05E8C6323EB554C5FF8D59BD610CEB0F91A32F7
```

The public [replay validation summary](docs/validation/replay-summary.json)
records the same identity. A byte-identical replay is required to reproduce
that exact 14,954-frame / 55-object experiment. Other `.rep` files can still be
used to exercise the same capture and reconstruction harness.

```powershell
.\.venv\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v
.\.venv\python.exe tools\frame_validation.py
.\.venv\python.exe tools\replay_validation.py C:\path\to\match.rep
.\.venv\python.exe tools\scenario_validation.py --loads 20 --runs 3
.\.venv\python.exe tools\vs_stress_validation.py --headless --runs 20 --frames 300
.\.venv\python.exe tools\headless_validation.py --unlimited --frames 10000
.\.venv\python.exe tools\unlimited_benchmark.py --mode unlimited --workers 8 --duration 5
```

Full local run logs are written to `logs/validation/` and excluded from Git.
The curated summaries under `docs/validation/` are versioned.

### Restricted sandbox test failure

The test suite creates a temporary recording directory under `tests/`. In a
filesystem-restricted runner, this test can fail even when the implementation is
healthy:

```text
test_writer_outputs_manifest_and_zero_drop_validity ... ERROR
PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied:
  D:\...\SokuRL\tests\tmp...\<timestamp>
```

This means the runner allowed the first temporary directory but denied its
nested session directory. It is a filesystem sandbox restriction, not a bridge,
protocol, or recorder assertion failure. Rerun the same suite from a normal host
PowerShell with write access to the repository:

```powershell
.\.venv\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v
```

The host-side verification for this revision passed all 17 tests. A failed
sandbox run can leave its `tests/tmp...` directory behind. List candidate
directories first, then remove only the exact path confirmed to belong to the
failed test:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem .\tests -Force -Directory -Filter "tmp*"
Remove-Item -LiteralPath .\tests\tmp<confirmed-name> -Recurse -Force
```

## Known Limits

The [rule policy pool](docs/rule-policy-pool.md) has 15 active policies, including
ten stateful tactics. PPO training and policy evaluation use the same roster.
The new tactics support both public state and diagnostic state observations.

- Only th123 1.10a with the documented executable hash is supported.
- Headless workers still create a window and initialize D3D, resources, and
  audio. SokuRL Platform is not a standalone reimplementation of the game.
- Eight workers were lossless on the validation machine; 16 workers saturated
  CPU and overflowed two frame rings.
- Practice currently accepts P2 movement input but filters P2 B/C attacks. The
  accepted projectile ScenarioRunner script controls `opponent: p1`.
- `24C` remains an explicit raw input sequence rather than a named macro.
- Native `GotoFrame` remains disabled. Episode reset creates a new battle.
  Action replay can reproduce a recorded trajectory; it is not a memory snapshot.
- Policy benchmarks for both tracks and network human play are not yet complete.
